# Input device

In DryWetMIDI an input MIDI device is represented by the [IInputDevice](xref:Melanchall.DryWetMidi.Multimedia.IInputDevice) interface. It allows to receive events from a MIDI device. To understand what an input MIDI device is in DryWetMIDI, please read the [Overview](Overview.md) article.

The library provides built-in implementation of `IInputDevice`: [InputDevice](xref:Melanchall.DryWetMidi.Multimedia.InputDevice) class. To get an instance of `InputDevice` you can use either [GetByName](xref:Melanchall.DryWetMidi.Multimedia.InputDevice.GetByName(System.String)) or [GetByIndex](xref:Melanchall.DryWetMidi.Multimedia.InputDevice.GetByIndex(System.Int32)) static methods. ID of a MIDI device is a number from `0` to _devices count minus one_. To get count of input MIDI devices presented in the system there is the [GetDevicesCount](xref:Melanchall.DryWetMidi.Multimedia.InputDevice.GetDevicesCount) method. You can get all input MIDI devices with the [GetAll](xref:Melanchall.DryWetMidi.Multimedia.InputDevice.GetAll) method.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can use `InputDevice` built-in implementation of `IInputDevice` only on the systems listed in the [Supported OS](xref:a_develop_supported_os) article. Of course you can create your own implementation of `IInputDevice` as described in the [Custom input device](#custom-input-device) section below.

After an instance of `InputDevice` is obtained, call [StartEventsListening](xref:Melanchall.DryWetMidi.Multimedia.IInputDevice.StartEventsListening) to start listening to incoming MIDI events going from an input MIDI device. If you don't need to listen for events anymore, call [StopEventsListening](xref:Melanchall.DryWetMidi.Multimedia.IInputDevice.StopEventsListening). Also this method will be called automatically on [Dispose](xref:Melanchall.DryWetMidi.Multimedia.MidiDevice.Dispose). To check whether `InputDevice` is currently listening for events or not use [IsListeningForEvents](xref:Melanchall.DryWetMidi.Multimedia.IInputDevice.IsListeningForEvents) property.

If an input device is listening for events, it will fire the [EventReceived](xref:Melanchall.DryWetMidi.Multimedia.IInputDevice.EventReceived) event for each incoming MIDI event. Received MIDI event will be passed to an event's handler.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you use an instance of the `InputDevice` within a `using` block, you need to be very careful. In general it's not a good practice and can cause problems. For example, with this code
> ```csharp
> using (var inputDevice = InputDevice.GetByName("Some MIDI device"))
> {
>     inputDevice.EventReceived += OnEventReceived;
>     inputDevice.StartEventsListening();
> }
> 
> // ...
> 
> private static void OnEventReceived(object? sender, MidiEventReceivedEventArgs e)
> {
>     // ...
> }
> ```
> the `OnEventReceived` method will not be probably called at all since the program leaves the `using` block before any event is received, and thus the device instance will be destroyed and not functioning of course.

Small example (console app) that shows receiving MIDI data:

```csharp
using System;
using Melanchall.DryWetMidi.Multimedia;

namespace InputDeviceExample
{
    class Program
    {
        private static IInputDevice _inputDevice;

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            _inputDevice = InputDevice.GetByName("Some MIDI device");
            _inputDevice.EventReceived += OnEventReceived;
            _inputDevice.StartEventsListening();

            Console.WriteLine("Input device is listening for events. Press any key to exit...");
            Console.ReadKey();

            (_inputDevice as IDisposable)?.Dispose();
        }

        private static void OnEventReceived(object sender, MidiEventReceivedEventArgs e)
        {
            var midiDevice = (MidiDevice)sender;
            Console.WriteLine($"Event received from '{midiDevice.Name}' at {DateTime.Now}: {e.Event}");
        }
    }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must always take care about disposing an `InputDevice`, so use it inside `using` block or call `Dispose` manually. Without it all resources taken by the device will live until GC collects them via the finalizer of the `InputDevice`. It means that sometimes you will not be able to use different instances of the same device across multiple applications or different pieces of a program.

`InputDevice` has the [MidiTimeCodeReceived](xref:Melanchall.DryWetMidi.Multimedia.InputDevice.MidiTimeCodeReceived) event which, by default, will be fired only when **all** MIDI Time Code components (separate [MidiTimeCodeEvent](xref:Melanchall.DryWetMidi.Core.MidiTimeCodeEvent) events) are received forming _hours:minutes:seconds:frames_ timestamp. You can turn this behavior off by setting [RaiseMidiTimeCodeReceived](xref:Melanchall.DryWetMidi.Multimedia.InputDevice.RaiseMidiTimeCodeReceived) to `false`.

If an invalid [channel](xref:Melanchall.DryWetMidi.Core.ChannelEvent), [system common](xref:Melanchall.DryWetMidi.Core.SystemCommonEvent) or [system real-time](xref:Melanchall.DryWetMidi.Core.SystemRealTimeEvent) or system exclusive event received, [ErrorOccurred](xref:Melanchall.DryWetMidi.Multimedia.MidiDevice.ErrorOccurred) event will be fired with the `Data` property of the exception filled with information about the error.

## Custom input device

You can create your own input device implementation and use it in your app. For example, let's create a device that will listen for specific keyboard keys and report corresponding notes via the [EventReceived](xref:Melanchall.DryWetMidi.Multimedia.IInputDevice.EventReceived) event. Also we will control the current octave with _up arrow_ and _down arrow_ keys increasing or decreasing octave number correspondingly. Following image shows the scheme of our device:

Now we implement it:

```csharp
public sealed class KeyboardInputDevice : IInputDevice
{
    public event EventHandler<MidiEventReceivedEventArgs> EventReceived;

    private static readonly Dictionary<ConsoleKey, NoteName> NotesNames = new Dictionary<ConsoleKey, NoteName>
    {
        [ConsoleKey.A] = NoteName.C,
        [ConsoleKey.W] = NoteName.CSharp,
        [ConsoleKey.S] = NoteName.D,
        [ConsoleKey.E] = NoteName.DSharp,
        [ConsoleKey.D] = NoteName.E,
        [ConsoleKey.F] = NoteName.F,
        [ConsoleKey.T] = NoteName.FSharp,
        [ConsoleKey.G] = NoteName.G,
        [ConsoleKey.Y] = NoteName.GSharp,
        [ConsoleKey.H] = NoteName.A,
        [ConsoleKey.U] = NoteName.ASharp,
        [ConsoleKey.J] = NoteName.B
    };

    private readonly Thread _thread;
            
    private int _octaveNumber = 4;
    private SevenBitNumber? _currentNoteNumber;

    public KeyboardInputDevice()
    {
        _thread = new Thread(ListenEvents);
    }

    public bool IsListeningForEvents { get; private set; }

    public void StartEventsListening()
    {
        _thread.Start();
        IsListeningForEvents = true;
    }

    public void StopEventsListening()
    {
        if (_currentNoteNumber != null)
            EventReceived?.Invoke(this, new MidiEventReceivedEventArgs(
                new NoteOffEvent(_currentNoteNumber.Value, SevenBitNumber.MinValue)));

        IsListeningForEvents = false;
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
    }

    private void ListenEvents()
    {
        while (IsListeningForEvents)
        {
            var key = Console.ReadKey(true);
            if (!NotesNames.TryGetValue(key.Key, out var noteName))
            {
                switch (key.Key)
                {
                    case ConsoleKey.UpArrow:
                        _octaveNumber++;
                        Console.WriteLine($"Octave is {_octaveNumber} now");
                        break;
                    case ConsoleKey.DownArrow:
                        _octaveNumber--;
                        Console.WriteLine($"Octave is {_octaveNumber} now");
                        break;
                    case ConsoleKey.Escape:
                        StopEventsListening();
                        Console.WriteLine("Listening stopped.");
                        break;
                }

                continue;
            }

            var noteNumber = CalculateNoteNumber(noteName, _octaveNumber);
            if (!IsNoteNumberValid(noteNumber))
                continue;

            if (_currentNoteNumber != null)
                EventReceived?.Invoke(this, new MidiEventReceivedEventArgs(
                    new NoteOffEvent(_currentNoteNumber.Value, SevenBitNumber.MinValue)));

            EventReceived?.Invoke(this, new MidiEventReceivedEventArgs(
                new NoteOnEvent((SevenBitNumber)noteNumber, SevenBitNumber.MaxValue)));

            _currentNoteNumber = (SevenBitNumber)noteNumber;
        }
    }

    private static bool IsNoteNumberValid(int noteNumber)
    {
        return noteNumber >= SevenBitNumber.MinValue && noteNumber <= SevenBitNumber.MaxValue;
    }

    private static int CalculateNoteNumber(NoteName noteName, int octave)
    {
        return (octave + 1) * Octave.OctaveSize + (int)noteName;
    }
}
```

We can then use it for [Recording](xref:Melanchall.DryWetMidi.Multimedia.Recording) or [redirecting](Devices-connector.md) received notes to real output device to make them sound:

```csharp
var outputDevice = OutputDevice.GetByName("Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth");
var devicesConnector = keyboardInputDevice.Connect(outputDevice);
```
