# Common problems

## `StartCoroutine` can only be called from the main thread in Unity

Sometimes you want to start Unity coroutine in a handler of the [EventReceived](xref:Melanchall.DryWetMidi.Multimedia.IInputDevice.EventReceived) event of [InputDevice](xref:Melanchall.DryWetMidi.Multimedia.InputDevice). Your code can be executed on a separate thread in this case. It can happen because events are received by device on a separate (system) thread.

But UI related things like call of `StartCoroutine` can be executed on UI thread only. You can use the solution from here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/56715254.

## `InputDevice` declared as a local variable

If an instance of the [InputDevice](xref:Melanchall.DryWetMidi.Multimedia.InputDevice) is declared as a local variable and you’ve subscribed to its [EventReceived](xref:Melanchall.DryWetMidi.Multimedia.IInputDevice.EventReceived) event, the event handler won’t be called or you can get undefined behavior. For example, let’s look at this code:

```csharp
private void StartListening()
{
    var inputDevice = InputDevice.GetByName("My Device");
    inputDevice.EventReceived += OnEventReceived;
    inputDevice.StartEventsListening();
}

private void OnEventReceived(object sender, MidiEventReceivedEventArgs e)
{
    // Do something ...
}
```

What happens when the `StartListening` method exits? Right, all local variables are marked as ready for garbage collection, so they will be deleted within a short time span. So the `OnEventReceived` method becomes attached to a deleted entity (`inputDevice`) when the `StartListening` exited. In the best case you just won't get `OnEventReceived` called. In worst case you may get different strange things, see this issues:

* [InputDevice event listening crash](https://github.com/melanchall/drywetmidi/issues/262)
* [Crash when running in Unity on M2 MacBook](https://github.com/melanchall/drywetmidi/issues/267)

Input device **must** be stored in a class field:

```csharp
private InputDevice _inputDevice;

private void StartListening()
{
    _inputDevice = InputDevice.GetByName("My Device");
    _inputDevice.EventReceived += OnEventReceived;
    _inputDevice.StartEventsListening();
}
```

And don't forget to dispose of the device when you're done with it. Please read the [Input device](xref:a_dev_input) article to learn more.
