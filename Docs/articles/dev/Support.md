# Support

Here you'll find information about how to create good issues on the DryWetMIDI so I (author of the library) can help you with your problem. The main rule – provide as many details as possible. I'm developing the library in my spare time and don't ask money for it. Please respect my time.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you make no effort to get your issue clear, I will make no effort to help you.

Things to pay attention for are:

1. If possible provide MIDI files you have problem with or create sample ones to reproduce the error or show what you want to do.
2. Provide the error message or/and screenshot of it in case of exception or build error.
3. Provide your code (as text, not as a screenshot!) and point me to the place there where the error occurred or where you need to do something.
4. What is your operating system?
5. What version of the library do you use?
6. Use proper MIDI terminology. Official MIDI specification can be found on the [midi.org](https://www.midi.org/specifications/midi1-specifications/midi-1-0-core-specifications/midi-1-0-detailed-specification-2).
7. Use formatting for your messages (especially for code blocks):  
    * on GitHub use [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax);
    * on emails use formatting provided by your mail client.
8. Use English language.

Creating an issue or a discussion on the project's GitHub page, be sure to provide short title and put all required info as the description.
