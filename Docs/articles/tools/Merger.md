# Merger

You can merge MIDI objects in different ways using extension methods from the [Merger](xref:Melanchall.DryWetMidi.Tools.Merger) class. In following subsections we'll look at some available methods:

* [objects merging](Objects-merging.md);
* [MIDI files merging](MIDI-files-merging.md).

Please note that these articles don't cover all possible methods and their settings. Please read API documentation on [Merger](xref:Melanchall.DryWetMidi.Tools.Merger) to get complete information.
